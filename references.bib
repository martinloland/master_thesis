abstract = {NASA-TLX is a multi-dimensional scale designed to obtain workload estimates from one or more operators while they are performing a task or immediately afterwards. The years of research that preceded subscale selection and the weighted averaging approach resulted in a tool that has proven to be reasonably easy to use and reliably sensitive to experimentally important manipulations over the past 20 years. Its use has spread far beyond its original application (aviation), focus (crew complement), and language (English). This survey of 550 studies in which NASA-TLX was used or reviewed was undertaken to provide a resource for a new generation of users. The goal was to summarize the environments in which it has been applied, the types of activities the raters performed, other variables that were measured that did (or did not) covary, methodological issues, and lessons learned},

Whenever an operator is forced to divide his limited resources (attention, cognition, etc.) among multiple robots, control becomes complicated and performance deteriorates as a result. Thus, we need to find ways to make command generation and coordination efficient, so that human-robot interaction becomes transparent and tasks are easy to perform. In this paper, we discuss how human-robot collaboration and dialogue provide an effective framework for achieving this.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: $\backslash$t $\backslash$nthe PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; $\backslash$t $\backslash$nthere is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; $\backslash$t $\backslash$nindividual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and $\backslash$t $\backslash$nindividuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

Most operators spontaneously adopted an effective “move-and-wait” strategy to cope with delay. A modification of a method proposed earlier enabled task-completion time to be accurately predicted from data taken when there was no delay. With the move-and-wait strategy, completion time depends on the length of sequences of open-loop movements. The number of such moves for positioning in one dimension as a function of task difficulty was found to agree with that predicted by a simple statistical model.},

abstract = { Attitude control refers to controlling the pitch and roll of a mobile robot. As environments grow more complex and cues to a robot's pose sparser it becomes easy for a teleoperator using an egocentric (camera) display to lose situational awareness. Reported difficulties with teleoperated robots frequently involve rollovers and sometimes even failure to realize that a robot has rolled over. Attitude information has conventionally been displayed separate from the camera view using an artificial horizon graphic or individual indicators for pitch and roll. Information from separate attitude displays may be difficult to integrate with an ongoing navigation task and lead to errors. In this paper we report an experiment in which a simulated robot is maneuvered over rough exterior and interior terrains to compare a gravity-referenced view with a separated attitude indication. Results show shorter task times and better path choices for users of the gravity-referenced view. },

This work presents a vision-based {\&}{\#}x201C;predictive display{\&}{\#}x201D; system that compensates for visual delay. The approach is online and relatively uncalibrated, thus it has the advantage of being useful in unknown environments and many applications. From monocular eye-in-hand video, we incrementally compute a 3D graphics model of the robot site in real time using our new technique. The method exploits free-space/occlusion constraints on the scene to produce a physically consistent mesh. Novel vantage points are immediately rendered in response to the operator's control commands, without waiting for delayed video. We implement a full prototype tele-operation system where the operator controls, via a PHANTOM Omni device, a Barrett WAM robot mounted on a mobile Segway. Experiments with this setup validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. We demonstrate significant improvement in task completion time with predictive display on a real robot, while our previous related results were established only in simulation.},

abstract = {In teleoperation systems, operator performance is negatively affected by time-delayed visual feedback. Predictive display (PD) compensates for delays by providing synthesized visual feedback. While most existing PD methods rely on a priori models (e.g., from laser range finding or stereo vision), recent work on monocular SLAM and SFM makes it possible to acquire PD models in single camera applications. In this work, we evaluate operator performance of PD visual feedback based on a coarse 3D model. We report the experimental results of 12 human tele-operators each performing 96 visual alignment tasks with a 300ms delay. Four operating modes are considered: delayed video (no PD), video-based PD using a stabilizing plane (homography), 3D model-based PD, and no delay (ground truth). The results indicate that vision-based PD (both plane and 3D model-based) is significantly better than delayed video. It reduced task completion time 40{\%} and is nearly as good as the no delay condition. PD based on a sparse a 3D model was somewhat better than the simpler plane based method.},

We discuss integrating a panoramic imaging system with prediction of viewing direction to create an effective telepresence system over low bandwidth links. Panoramic imaging using a reflective mirror surface offers an alternative to pan-tilt systems for obtaining a 360 degree field of view. Selecting a small window within a panoramic image allows a meaningful part of an image from a remote site to be seen at a higher refresh rate. Because of the delay in transmitting an image from a remote site, it is necessary to have additional image information available locally. This information can be used to simulate continuously flowing pictures with reduced apparent delay. Continuity in image viewing is achieved by predicting the next viewpoint of an operator and preemptively transmitting parts of an image. Experimental results are given to evaluate the proposed telepresence system},

abstract = {There is ample research on the effect of haptic teleoperation under delayed communication channels in terms of stability and system performance. Little attention, however, has been paid to the effect of delayed force feedback on users' task performance and whether force feedback is beneficial under significant communication delays. This paper investigates whether force feedback improves user's task performance in delayed teleoperation. We study peg-in-the-hole insertion/retraction, dexterous manipulation tasks involving high degrees of freedom and high forces at certain points during task execution. A user study involving unilateral (without force feedback), bilateral (with force feedback) and graphical feedback teleoperation under various delays is presented. We observed that for all feedback modalities, task completion times increase as delay increases. Haptic feedback helps reduce contact forces and the occurrence of large robot/environment forces. Furthermore, graphical feedback helps users maintain the lowest range of forces at the cost of higher task completion times. With users mindful of minimizing contact forces, haptic/graphical feedback causes the task to take more time than unilateral control. Therefore, when short completion times are crucial given a tolerance for larger forces, force feedback only serves to increase the time required to perform the task; thus, unilateral control may be sufficient.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.Background: Few telesurgery studies assess the impact of latency on user experience, low latencies are often not studied despite evidence of negative effects, and some studies recruit inexperienced subjects instead of surgeons without evidence that latency affects both groups similarly. Methods: Fifteen trainees and fourteen laparoscopic surgeons conducted two tasks on a laparoscopy home-trainer at six latencies below 200 milliseconds (ms). Completion time and usability (perceived awareness of latency, inefficiency, disturbance, adaptability, and impact on patient safety) were measured. Results: Weak correlation between completion time and usability was found. There was significant deterioration in performance and user experience at 105ms added latency. Surgeons were more negatively affected. Conclusion: Objective measures insufficiently describe the impact of latency therefore standard measures of user experience should be incorporated in studies. Even low latencies may be detrimental to laparoscopic surgery. Results from non-experts cannot predict the impact of latency on experienced surgeons.},

@article{Powers2011,
abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that for unacquainted dyads and groups interacting over video, feedback delay can interfere with the impression-formation process and increase cognitive load, in turn leading to incorrect interpersonal judgments. In this study, 35 dyads participated in two 10-min conversation periods over video monitors. In one period there was a 1-s delay in the audio/video signal and in the other there was no delay. In period 1 the presence of feedback delay was associated with decreased frustration and increased ability to accurately judge a partner's emotions. In period 2, however, feedback delay was associated with increased frustration and had no effect on emotion communication accuracy, which was decreased in both conditions by inaccurate assumed similarity. Results supported and expanded the relation-alignment perspective, which states that individuals will consciously attempt to manage their impressions over technological channels, but that they can also be unconsciously influenced by technological distortion. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper considers the visual impression in a human robot interaction where a robot imitates the human motion obtained by Microsoft Kinect. In this interaction, a subject swings both arms up and down while Kinect measures the subject's motion and this motion is sent to the robot with a certain delay time. In the above situation, firstly, this paper quantitatively shows the perceptible delay time for a human when the robot motion is delayed with respect to own motion. Next, this paper investigates human impressions when he/she watches the robot motion being not synchronized to his/her motion. Last, the difference of the impressions to the delay and synchronic robot motion is statistically verified.},
