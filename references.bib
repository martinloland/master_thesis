Most operators spontaneously adopted an effective “move-and-wait” strategy to cope with delay. A modification of a method proposed earlier enabled task-completion time to be accurately predicted from data taken when there was no delay. With the move-and-wait strategy, completion time depends on the length of sequences of open-loop movements. The number of such moves for positioning in one dimension as a function of task difficulty was found to agree with that predicted by a simple statistical model.},

abstract = {An enhanced teleoperation technique for time-delayed bilateral$\backslash$nteleoperator control is discussed. The control technique selected for$\backslash$ntime delay is based on the use of a high-fidelity graphics phantom robot$\backslash$nthat is being controlled in real time (without time delay) against the$\backslash$nstatic task image. Thus, the motion of the phantom robot image on the$\backslash$nmonitor predicts the motion of the real robot. The real robot's motion$\backslash$nwill follow the phantom robot's motion on the monitor with the$\backslash$ncommunication time delay implied in the task. Real-time high-fidelity$\backslash$ngraphics simulation of a PUMA arm is generated and overlaid on the$\backslash$nactual camera view of the arm. A simple camera calibration technique is$\backslash$nused for calibrated graphics overlay. A preliminary experiment is$\backslash$nperformed with the predictive display by using a very simple tapping$\backslash$ntask. The results with this simple task indicate that predictive display$\backslash$nenhanced the human operator's telemanipulation task performance$\backslash$nsignificantly during free motion when there is a long time delay. It$\backslash$nappears, however, that either two-view or stereoscopic predictive$\backslash$ndisplays are necessary for general three-dimensional tasks},

abstract = {The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: $\backslash$t $\backslash$nthe PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; $\backslash$t $\backslash$nthere is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; $\backslash$t $\backslash$nindividual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and $\backslash$t $\backslash$nindividuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

We discuss integrating a panoramic imaging system with prediction of viewing direction to create an effective telepresence system over low bandwidth links. Panoramic imaging using a reflective mirror surface offers an alternative to pan-tilt systems for obtaining a 360 degree field of view. Selecting a small window within a panoramic image allows a meaningful part of an image from a remote site to be seen at a higher refresh rate. Because of the delay in transmitting an image from a remote site, it is necessary to have additional image information available locally. This information can be used to simulate continuously flowing pictures with reduced apparent delay. Continuity in image viewing is achieved by predicting the next viewpoint of an operator and preemptively transmitting parts of an image. Experimental results are given to evaluate the proposed telepresence system},

Delays as low as a few hundred milliseconds between commanding an action and getting the visual feedback reduce the operator's performance. Predictive displays have proven their suitability to compensate for these delays, but at the expense of image quality when using computer-generated images. A photorealistic predictive display is presented that closes the feedback loop locally at the operator's side of a telepresence system. Photorealism is achieved using delayed camera images for texturing the predicted scene. Consumer graphics hardware is not only used for rendering but also for hardware-accelerated texture extraction. To allow concurrent access to model data, a multibuffer model structure is presented. A model of the teleoperator's environment is automatically acquired and updated by image processing techniques using a stereo camera as the only sensor.},

abstract = { Attitude control refers to controlling the pitch and roll of a mobile robot. As environments grow more complex and cues to a robot's pose sparser it becomes easy for a teleoperator using an egocentric (camera) display to lose situational awareness. Reported difficulties with teleoperated robots frequently involve rollovers and sometimes even failure to realize that a robot has rolled over. Attitude information has conventionally been displayed separate from the camera view using an artificial horizon graphic or individual indicators for pitch and roll. Information from separate attitude displays may be difficult to integrate with an ongoing navigation task and lead to errors. In this paper we report an experiment in which a simulated robot is maneuvered over rough exterior and interior terrains to compare a gravity-referenced view with a separated attitude indication. Results show shorter task times and better path choices for users of the gravity-referenced view. },

abstract = {A teleoperated surgical robotic system allows surgical procedures to be conducted across long distances while utilizing wired and wireless communication with a wide spectrum of performance that may affect the outcome. An open architecture portable surgical robotic system (Raven) was developed for both open and minimally invasive surgery. The system has been the subject of an intensive telesurgical experimental protocol aimed at exploring the boundaries of the system and surgeon performance during a series of field experiments in extreme environments (desert and underwater) teleportation between US, Europe, and Japan as well as lab experiments under synthetic fixed time delay. One standard task (block transfer emulating tissue manipulation) of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) training kit was used for the experimental protocol. Network characterization indicated a typical time delay in the range of 16-172 ms in field experiments. The results of the lab experiments showed that the completion time of the task as well as the length of the tool tip trajectory significantly increased (alpha{\textless} 0.02) as time delay increased in the range of 0-0.5 sec increased. For teleoperation with a time delay of 0.25s and 0.5s the task completion time was lengthened by a factor of 1.45 and 2.04 with respect to no time delay, whereas the length of the tools' trajectory was increased by a factor of 1.28 and 1.53 with respect to no time delay. There were no statistical differences between experienced surgeons and non-surgeons in the number of errors (block drooping) as well as the completion time and the tool tip path length at different time delays.},

This work presents a vision-based {\&}{\#}x201C;predictive display{\&}{\#}x201D; system that compensates for visual delay. The approach is online and relatively uncalibrated, thus it has the advantage of being useful in unknown environments and many applications. From monocular eye-in-hand video, we incrementally compute a 3D graphics model of the robot site in real time using our new technique. The method exploits free-space/occlusion constraints on the scene to produce a physically consistent mesh. Novel vantage points are immediately rendered in response to the operator's control commands, without waiting for delayed video. We implement a full prototype tele-operation system where the operator controls, via a PHANTOM Omni device, a Barrett WAM robot mounted on a mobile Segway. Experiments with this setup validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. We demonstrate significant improvement in task completion time with predictive display on a real robot, while our previous related results were established only in simulation.},

abstract = {In teleoperation systems, operator performance is negatively affected by time-delayed visual feedback. Predictive display (PD) compensates for delays by providing synthesized visual feedback. While most existing PD methods rely on a priori models (e.g., from laser range finding or stereo vision), recent work on monocular SLAM and SFM makes it possible to acquire PD models in single camera applications. In this work, we evaluate operator performance of PD visual feedback based on a coarse 3D model. We report the experimental results of 12 human tele-operators each performing 96 visual alignment tasks with a 300ms delay. Four operating modes are considered: delayed video (no PD), video-based PD using a stabilizing plane (homography), 3D model-based PD, and no delay (ground truth). The results indicate that vision-based PD (both plane and 3D model-based) is significantly better than delayed video. It reduced task completion time 40{\%} and is nearly as good as the no delay condition. PD based on a sparse a 3D model was somewhat better than the simpler plane based method.},

abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that for unacquainted dyads and groups interacting over video, feedback delay can interfere with the impression-formation process and increase cognitive load, in turn leading to incorrect interpersonal judgments. In this study, 35 dyads participated in two 10-min conversation periods over video monitors. In one period there was a 1-s delay in the audio/video signal and in the other there was no delay. In period 1 the presence of feedback delay was associated with decreased frustration and increased ability to accurately judge a partner's emotions. In period 2, however, feedback delay was associated with increased frustration and had no effect on emotion communication accuracy, which was decreased in both conditions by inaccurate assumed similarity. Results supported and expanded the relation-alignment perspective, which states that individuals will consciously attempt to manage their impressions over technological channels, but that they can also be unconsciously influenced by technological distortion. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is ample research on the effect of haptic teleoperation under delayed communication channels in terms of stability and system performance. Little attention, however, has been paid to the effect of delayed force feedback on users' task performance and whether force feedback is beneficial under significant communication delays. This paper investigates whether force feedback improves user's task performance in delayed teleoperation. We study peg-in-the-hole insertion/retraction, dexterous manipulation tasks involving high degrees of freedom and high forces at certain points during task execution. A user study involving unilateral (without force feedback), bilateral (with force feedback) and graphical feedback teleoperation under various delays is presented. We observed that for all feedback modalities, task completion times increase as delay increases. Haptic feedback helps reduce contact forces and the occurrence of large robot/environment forces. Furthermore, graphical feedback helps users maintain the lowest range of forces at the cost of higher task completion times. With users mindful of minimizing contact forces, haptic/graphical feedback causes the task to take more time than unilateral control. Therefore, when short completion times are crucial given a tolerance for larger forces, force feedback only serves to increase the time required to perform the task; thus, unilateral control may be sufficient.},

abstract = {Tele-operation of a Lunar rover from a control station on Earth involves a latency of several seconds due primarily to the finite speed (light-speed) of command and sensor signals, and this latency creates a difficult control task for the human operator. Two predictive displays, which seek to aid viewer perception of present events, were designed and evaluated for the specific task of driving a rover with multi-second latency. These displays provided visual information to the human operator on the rover's real-time locomotion, as predicted from control inputs executed by the operator. A human-subject experiment with 12 participants was conducted in which the participants navigated an actual rover through obstacle courses. There were four experimental conditions repeated by each participant: (1) delayed video feed only, (2, 3) two predictive displays based on delayed video feed, and (4) a reference condition of video feed with no delay. Inferential statistics show that both predictive displays significantly improved performance in terms of time taken to complete the courses, and one of the displays facilitated performance approaching that with no delay. No trends were observed in terms of collisions with or encroachments near obstacles.},

abstract = {A teleoperated vehicle is a vehicle operated by a human from a distance by means of a communication network. One important challenge with teleoperated vehicles is that communication delays in the network can negatively affect the mobility performance of the vehicle. This paper adopts and further develops a model-free predictor framework to compensate for communication delays and improve vehicle mobility where the term “model-free” indicates that the predictor does not need to know the dynamic equations governing the system. This framework has previously been conceived and applied to the teleoperated vehicle domain; however, prior evaluations have been conducted with simulated drivers and for only the speed control of the vehicle. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, the framework is further developed to improve the transient response of the predictors by including a saturation and resetting scheme. Second, to evaluate the effectiveness of the predictor framework with human drivers and combined speed and steering control, a human-in-the-loop simulation platform is developed to emulate a driving task in a virtual environment. Using this platform, human-in-the-loop experiments are performed, where humans are tasked with driving a typical military truck as fast as possible while keeping it as close as possible to the center of the track. Three types of experiments are conducted: (1) without communication delays as a benchmark; (2) with communication delays, but without the predictor framework to quantify the mobility performance degradation due to delays; and (3) with communication delays and the predictor framework to evaluate the change in mobility performance due to the predictor framework. Three metrics are used to quantify performance; namely, track completion time and track keeping error are used to quantify the speed and lateral control performance, respectively, and the steering control effort is monitored to assess drivability. Five drivers repeated each type of experiment seven times, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to statistically analyze the results. The conclusion is that the predictor framework improves the mobility performance of the vehicle and increases drivability significantly.},

Methods: Fifteen trainees and fourteen laparoscopic surgeons conducted two tasks on a laparoscopy home-trainer at six latencies below 200 milliseconds (ms). Completion time and usability (perceived awareness of latency, inefficiency, disturbance, adaptability, and impact on patient safety) were measured. Results: Weak correlation between completion time and usability was found. There was significant deterioration in performance and user experience at 105ms added latency. Surgeons were more negatively affected. Conclusion: Objective measures insufficiently describe the impact of latency therefore standard measures of user experience should be incorporated in studies. Even low latencies may be detrimental to laparoscopic surgery. Results from non-experts cannot predict the impact of latency on experienced surgeons.},

@article{Draper1998,
abstract = {Telepresence, the perception of presence within a physically remote or simulated site, has been identified as a design ideal for synthetic environments. However, confusion exists within the literature about the precise definition of telepresence. Furthermore, there is a need for a plausible and parsimonious model of telepresence. This paper identifies three types of telepresence extant in the literature: simple telepresence, cybernetic telepresence, and experiential telepresence. The third definition is the most interesting. This paper reviews the origins of experiential telepresence and the theoretical approaches commonly used to explain it. One can term these technological approaches, which emphasize the role of control/display technology, and psychological approaches, which identify experiential telepresence with known psychological phenomena. Finally, the paper presents and discusses an integrative approach to telepresence featuring a structured attentional resource model. Actual or potential applications of this research include the design of future human-machine interfaces for teleoperated robots and virtual reality systems.},

@article{Arthur1993,
abstract = {''Fish tank virtual reality'' refers to the use of a standard graphics workstation to achieve real-time display of 3D scenes using stereopsis and dynamic head-coupled perspective. Fish tank VR has a number of advantages over head-mounted immersion VR which makes it more practical for many applications. After discussing the characteristics of fish tank VR, we describe a set of three experiments conducted to study the benefits of fish tank VR over a traditional workstation graphics display. These experiments tested user performance under two conditions: (a) whether or not stereoscopic display was used and (b) whether or not the perspective display was coupled dynamically to the positions of a user's eyes. Subjects using a comparison protocol consistently preferred head coupling without stereo over stereo without head coupling. Error rates in a tree-tracing task similar to one used by Sollenberger and Milgram showed an order of magnitude improvement for head-coupled stereo over a static (nonhead-coupled) display, and the benefits gained by head coupling were more significant than those gained from stereo alone. The final experiment examined two factors that are often associated with human performance in virtual worlds: the lag (or latency) in receiving and processing tracker data and the rate at which frames are updated. For the tree-tracing task, lag had a larger impact on performance than did frame update rate, with lag having a multiplicative effect on response time. We discuss the relevance of these results for the display of complex 3D data and highlight areas requiring further study.},

@article{Nielsen2007,
abstract = {Navigation is an essential element of many remote robot operations including search and rescue, reconnaissance, and space exploration. Previous reports on using remote mobile robots suggest that navigation is difficult due to poor situation awareness. It has been recommended by experts in human-robot interaction that interfaces between humans and robots provide more spatial information and better situational context in order to improve an operator's situation awareness. This paper presents an ecological interface paradigm that combines video, map, and robot-pose information into a 3-D mixed-reality display. The ecological paradigm is validated in planar worlds by comparing it against the standard interface paradigm in a series of simulated and real-world user studies. Based on the experiment results, observations in the literature, and working hypotheses, we present a series of principles for presenting information to an operator of a remote robot.},

@article{Fabrizio2000,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Telementoring allows a less experienced surgeon to benefit from an expert surgical consultation, reducing cost, travel, and the learning curve associated with new procedures. However, there are several technical limitations that affect practical applications. One potentially serious problem is the time delay that occurs any time data are transferred across long distances. To date, the effect of time delay on surgical performance has not been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS A two-phase trial was designed to examine the effect of time delay on surgical performance. In the first phase, a series of tasks was performed, and the numbers of robotic movements required for completion was counted. Programmed incremental time delays were made in audiovisual acquisition and robotic controls. The number of errors made while performing each task at various time delay intervals was noted. In the second phase, a remote surgeon in Baltimore performed the tasks 9000 miles away in Singapore. The number of errors made was recorded. RESULTS As the time delay increased, the number of operator errors increased. The accuracy needed to perform remote robotic procedures was diminished as the time delay increased. A learning curve did exist for each task, but as the time delay interval increased, it took longer to complete the task. CONCLUSIONS Time delay does affect surgical performance. There is an acceptable delay of {\textless}700 msec in which surgeons can compensate for this phenomenon. Clinical studies will be needed to evaluate the true impact of time delay.},

abstract = {The sources of lag (the delay between input action and output response) and its effects on human performance are discussed. We measured the effects in a study of target acquisition using the classic Fitts' law paradigm with the addition of four lag conditions. At the highest lag tested (225 ms), movement times and error rates increased by 64{\%} and 214{\%} respectively, compared to the zero lag condition. We propose a model according to which lag should have a multiplicative effect on Fitts' index of difficulty. The model accounts for 94{\%} of the variance and is better than alternative models which propose only an additive effect for lag. The implications for the design of virtual rerdity systems are discussed.},

Performing precise tasks with a robot arm is usually difficult because of the communication time delay involved with data transfer via the Internet.

The necessary control variables for following a curved trajectory are analyzed, the effectiveness of superimposed predictor symbology is investigated, and a suitable predictor law is formulated. The theoretical considerations are validated by an extensive fixed-base simulator program. The tunnel display with a superimposed predictor symbol is shown to outperform conventional-type displays in its abilities to follow a curved trajectory in the presence of gust disturbances, to enter the trajectory from an unknown position outside this trajectory, as well as to monitor automatic approaches. The feasibility of the tunnel display for operation in actual flight has been demonstrated in an exploratory flight test.},

The experimental tasks included simple cognitive and manual control tasks, complex laboratory and supervisory control tasks, and aircraft simulation. Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition. A multi-dimensional rating scale is proposed in which information about the magnitude and sources of six workload-related factors are combined to derive a sensitive and reliable estimate of workload.},
