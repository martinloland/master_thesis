in the situations where you are creating your own there are some issues: require apps, exposed to all the code, hard to change, combination of multiple packages, low support for parllellism, don't support keyboard use, insetad buttons, no documentation

\citep{Chen2007} "Attitude (i.e., pitch and roll) of a robotic vehicle may be easy to reference when there are other familiar objects (e.g., horizon, buildings, trees, etc.) in the re- mote environment.However, if those reference points are absent and the on-board cameras are fixed, operators sometimes find it surprisingly hard to accurately assess the attitude of their robotic vehicles."

\citep{Wang2004} Gravity-Referenced Attitude Display for Teleoperation of Mobile Robots

\citep{Chen2007} "The ideal view depends on the task; overall awareness and pattern recognition are optimized by exocentric views whereas the immediate environment is often viewed better egocentrically."
"overlaying information on video feed can potentially lead to cognitive tunneling"
