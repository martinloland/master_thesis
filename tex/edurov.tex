\citep{Chen2007} "Attitude (i.e., pitch and roll) of a robotic vehicle may be easy to reference when there are other familiar objects (e.g., horizon, buildings, trees, etc.) in the re- mote environment.However, if those reference points are absent and the on-board cameras are fixed, operators sometimes find it surprisingly hard to accurately assess the attitude of their robotic vehicles."

\citep{Chen2007} "The ideal view depends on the task; overall awareness and pattern recognition are optimized by exocen- tric views whereas the immediate environment is often viewed better egocentrically."
"overlaying information on video feed can potentially lead to cognitive tunneling"
