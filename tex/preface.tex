This document represents the final dissertation of Martin Løland in connection with the master thesis written in the spring of 2018 at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.

eduROV is a project started in Trondheim which aims to create an affordable and open-source remotely operated vehicle for use by students and hobbyists. During the spring of 2018 work was done on this project as part of this dissertation. In addition, it became evident that there was a lack of solutions for predictive displays that would suit the open source project of eduROV.

During the semester a new python package for robot control and video feed was developed. In addition, a simple predictive display that can be applied to many remotely operated vehicles was created and tested. This was the first encounter with an experiment including people. It provided many interesting challenges concerning experiment design and statistical analysis.

I would like to thank PhD Candidate Kristoffer B Slåttsveen for his feedback on the development of the python package and thesis. I also want to thank my supervisor Professor Martin Steinert who has been very helpful with pointing me in the right direction for interesting research topics. Lastly, PhD Candidate Achim Gerstenberg has provided helpful information about statistical analysis and robot experiments.
