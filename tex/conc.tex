\section{Future work}
\subsection{Predictive display}
\todo[inline]{
- h264 compression tracking could be used for live improvement of the predictor display

- it might be better to crop with different windows instead of moving the video, people reported that it was disturbing

- many get fixated on the real center pin even though there is a red arrow there, it would be interesting to see if they performed better without any real reference

- wider FOV

- live machine learning to better predict the movement (speed, incline, battery power etc.)
