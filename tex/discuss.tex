\todo[inline]{
- is the effect size valuable?

- comparison to other predictor displays

- Keystrokes per exp

- Learning effects

- Subjective delay times

- Computer and gaming frequency

- Subjective performance vs real performance

- can the data be misinterpreted?

- what could be done differently?

- this is a test on how it works on intuition, they may have performed better if they were told how the PD works
