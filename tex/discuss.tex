\section{Performance}
\todo[inline]{
- is the effect size valuable?

- comparison to other predictor displays

- Keystrokes per exp

- Learning effects

- Computer and gaming frequency

- can the data be misinterpreted?

- what could be done differently?

- this is a test on how it works on intuition, they may have performed better if they were told how the PD works

\section{Future work}
\subsection{Predictive display}
\todo[inline]{
- h264 compression tracking could be used for live improvement of the predictor display

- it might be better to crop with different windows instead of moving the video, people reported that it was disturbing

- many get fixated on the real center pin even though there is a red arrow there, it would be interesting to see if they performed better without any real reference

- wider FOV

- live machine learning to better predict the movement (speed, incline, battery power etc.)

- websockets

- flask?
