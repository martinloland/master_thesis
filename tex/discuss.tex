\textbf{Todo}

- what kind of display gave the best user performance?

- what did the users have to say about the different displays?

- how does performance and user opinion correlate?

- what does the results mean?

- how dos gaming effect the results?

- how is the effects size?

- tlx performance vs real performance

- difference in wait and move strategy / n keystrokes

- how does the results compare to other predictor displays

- how does the negative effect because of delay compare to other trials?

- what are the causes and factors?

- other possible ways to interpret the data?

- what could be done differently?

\section{Future work}

\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- h264 compression tracking could be used for live improvement of the predictor display

- it might be better to crop with different windows instead of moving the video, people reported that it was disturbing

- many get fixated on the real center pin even though there is a red arrow there, it would be interesting to see if they performed better without any real reference

- wider FOV

- websockets

- flask?

- live machine learning to better predict the movement (speed, incline, battery power etc.)
