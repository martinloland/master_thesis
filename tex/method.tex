\section{Predictive display by real-time transforming video}
\todo[inline]{
\textbf{Todo}

- very similar to \citep{Matheson2013} projected display, does not seem to handle rotation very well, does include an arrow as a avatar robot

- it is normal to generate a 3d environment, but is that really necessary?

- is it enough to show the movement by translating and scaling the video?

    \subsection{Translation calculations}
    
    \citep{Matheson2013} "Also, since the predictive displays are merely modifications of the most recent video, any errors due to modelling and prediction are not cumulative."

\section{Experimental design}
	\subsection{Teleoperation of robot in a room}
	\todo[inline]{
	\textbf{Todo}
	
	- "human subject experiments"
	
	- keep it simple to reduce variance i results, but complex enough that the effects of video delay would be noticeable (and predictor could help)
	
	- avoid ceiling effects (to slow robot/to easy tasks)
	
	- running a warmup where the user familiarizes himself with the input device and kinematics of the robot
	
	- random order for all displays, time for warmup
	
	-where is the user looking
	
	- "delay conditions were presented to the participants in a counterbalanced order to control for possible learning effects."

    \subsection{Information}
    \todo[inline]{
    \textbf{Todo}
    
    - the goal of the experiment
    
    - be aware of getting to close to the wall
    
    - rocker wheel at the back
    
    - information page of the task
    
    - were NOT told that one of the displays is a predictor displays

    \subsection{Task}
    \subsection{Metrics}
    \todo[inline]{
    \textbf{Todo}
    
    - focus on speed, not so much on accuracy / collisions
    
    - Number of button presses
    
    - change in rate of presses (learning)
    
    - frequency of presses (presses / minute)
    
    - wheel movement
    
    - telepresence
    
    - user satisfaction

    - move to results?
    
    - population
    
    - age group
    
    - computer knowledge

    - volunteer
    
    - sample size calculations
    }
    \subsection{Questionnaire}
    \todo[inline]{
    \textbf{Todo}
    
    - how demanding each task was from the operator's points of view.
    
    - nasa tlx load index with likert scale
    
    - which questions were asked?
    
    - how where they asked?
