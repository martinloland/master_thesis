\section{Performance}

\figref{performanceNorm} shows the normalized score, number of hits in 90 seconds, for each of the display types and all participants. A similar figure with non-normalized values can be found in the appendix at page \textbf{TODO}. \textit{Delay} refers to the \textit{added} delay, which means that "No delay" translates to the inherent system delay of $250 ms$. The numerical score values together with the standard deviation is reported in table \ref{score}. In addition, the percentage difference in means between displays is also reported in that table. The statistical significance and effect size between conditions can be seen in table \ref{score2}.

Using normalized scores, participants performed on average 20.29\% better using the predictive display versus no predictive display, $t(56)=4.82$, $p<.001$, $d=0.735$. In comparison, the subjects performed on average 153.32\% better in the no delay condition versus the delayed condition without predictive help, $t(56)=23.04$, $p<.001$, $d=4.413$. All differences are statistically significant.
