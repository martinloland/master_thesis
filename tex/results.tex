\item[H1:] Participants performed on average 20.62\% better using the predictive display versus no predictive display, t(56)=4.80, p$<$.001, d=0.904. H1, that a simple predictor display based on image transformation can increase the operator performance, is therefore verified.

\item[H2:] The participants did not reported any significant difference in the mental, physical or temporal demand using the predictive display. H2, that a simple predictor display based on image transformation will decrease the operator's subjective workload, has to be rejected.

\section{Performance}

\figref{performanceNorm} shows the normalized number of hits in 90 seconds (score), for each display type and all N=57 participants. \textit{Delay} refers to the \textit{added} delay, which means that "No delay" translates to the inherent system delay of $250 ms$. The numerical values are reported in Table \ref{score}. The statistical significance and effect size between conditions can be seen in Table \ref{score2}.

All  Those who play games weekly or more were defined as \emph{gamers}. They performed on average 30.13\% better, while non-gamers only saw a 16.91\% performance increase with the PD. This difference is illustrated in \figref{gamer_performance}.

\section{Task load index}

\figref{tlx} shows the reported NASA TLX scores. The height of the bar describes the mean value while the whiskers shows the SD. Numerical values are reported in Table \ref{tlx_values}.

There are no big differences between condition one and two. The only significant differences between those two conditions can be found in the \emph{performance}, t(56)=3.24, p=0.002, d=0.360 and \emph{frustration}, t(56)=2.15, p=0.036, d=0.271 metric. This means that the subjects felt less frustration and evaluated their performance as better when using the predictive display.

\section{Subjective delay}

\figref{subjective_delay_norm} shows the normalized reported total delay in seconds for the three conditions. The participants reported a 11\% decrease in subjective latency using the predictive display versus the normal display with the same latency. This results is however not significant, t(56)=1.40, p=0.167, d=0.356.

\section{Key presses}

\figref{keypresses} shows the number of key presses performed during the 90 seconds of task time for each display type. With a low latency, participants are in a greater degree trying to continuously maneuver the ROV.
